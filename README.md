## Description
This repository contains a team assembler application that takes user inputs from the command line to generate a qualitative html file containing various work roles. The application utilizes js classes, npm inquirer, and tests as its mechanisms and in its development. When tackling projects within a company organization is key. An automated team assembler is a great way to save time, organize and provide general structure to a team.



## Development
To begin a rough outline was developed of how the html would appear, which classes would be utilized, and which functions would generate the readme. After the classes were created, a test file was created to make sure they were storing the proper data and whose functions worked. Next a seperate js file was created that utilized npms inquirer to to prompt the user for what kind of employee they would like to add and information on that employee. this information was stored in the class constructor functions then used to to create cards which were then ultimately written to a newly created html file.


## Instillation
To use this application make sure you have jnode installed- https://nodejs.org/en/ . Next you will clone this repository to a desired location on your device, navigate to the repository from the terminal and type npm-i to initialize the necessary modules.

## Usage
check out my youtube tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MjHWsxk-bw&ab_channel=PierceGladfelter

To use this application, navigate to the repository on your device via the terminal and type node index.js. you will then be prompted with a series of questions in the terminal that will give you the options to add a manager, engineer(s), and intern(s) and information for you to fill out on each employee. After an intern or engineer is added and you decide you are  finished and would like to create your team, an index.html file will be created within the dist folder.


## Tests
Tests were created to see if the classes methods and functions properly stored input arguments and if their methods worked.
